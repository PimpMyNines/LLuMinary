# GitHub Project Management Tool Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan to create a Python-based GitHub project management tool as a feature branch of https://github.com/PimpMyNines/github-project-management. This tool will replace the existing bash scripts and provide a more robust solution for managing projects, issues, sub-issues, and roadmap tasks.

## Features

1. **Issue Management**
   - Create issues and sub-issues
   - Establish parent-child relationships using the GitHub Sub-issues API
   - Convert tasks in issue descriptions to proper sub-issues
   - Update existing issues with sub-issue references

2. **Project Management**
   - Create and configure GitHub projects
   - Manage project views, fields, and settings
   - Add/remove issues to/from projects
   - Update issue status within projects

3. **Roadmap Management**
   - Create and update milestone-based roadmaps
   - Track progress against roadmap items
   - Generate roadmap reports

4. **Integration Features**
   - Import/export issue data from/to JSON, CSV
   - Sync issues between repositories
   - Batch operations across multiple repositories

## Technical Approach

1. **Core Architecture**
   - Use Python with PyGithub library for GitHub API access
   - Implement CLI interface with click or argparse
   - Create modular design with separate components for issues, projects, etc.
   - Support configuration via config files and environment variables

2. **Authentication**
   - Support both personal access tokens and GitHub Apps
   - Implement secure token storage and management
   - Handle organization-level permissions appropriately

3. **Error Handling**
   - Implement robust error handling for API failures
   - Provide clear, actionable error messages
   - Include retry logic for transient errors
   - Support dry-run mode for validation

4. **Documentation**
   - Comprehensive CLI help text
   - Markdown documentation with examples
   - Configuration reference guide
   - Troubleshooting guide

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1: Issue Management**
   - Implement core issue CRUD operations
   - Add support for sub-issues API
   - Create task-to-sub-issue conversion functionality
   - Ensure backward compatibility with existing scripts

2. **Phase 2: Project Integration**
   - Implement project management features
   - Add issue-project associations
   - Create project views and configuration

3. **Phase 3: Roadmap Features**
   - Implement milestone management
   - Add roadmap visualization
   - Create progress tracking and reporting

4. **Phase 4: Advanced Features**
   - Add batch operations
   - Implement cross-repository sync
   - Create import/export functionality

## Migration Path

To transition from the existing bash scripts:

1. Create feature branch in github-project-management repository
2. Implement core functionality to match existing scripts
3. Add Python package setup for easy installation
4. Create sample scripts that replicate current functionality
5. Update GitHub Actions to use the new tool
6. Provide documentation for migration

## Benefits

1. **Improved Reliability**: Python with proper libraries will be more robust than bash scripts
2. **Better Error Handling**: Structured error handling and reporting
3. **Enhanced Capabilities**: Access to full GitHub API feature set
4. **Easier Maintenance**: More maintainable code structure
5. **Cross-Platform**: Will work on Windows, macOS, and Linux
6. **Extensibility**: Easier to add new features

## Timeline

- Feature Branch Creation: 1 day
- Phase 1 Implementation: 1 week
- Phase 2 Implementation: 1 week
- Phase 3 Implementation: 1 week
- Phase 4 Implementation: 1 week
- Testing and Documentation: 1 week
- Migration Support: Ongoing

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/PimpMyNines/github-project-management.git`
2. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/python-project-tools`
3. Set up Python environment: `python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate`
4. Install required packages: `pip install pygithub click pyyaml`
5. Begin implementing core functionality
