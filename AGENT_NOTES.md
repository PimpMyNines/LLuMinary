# LLuMinary CI Pipeline Improvement Project

## Overview

This document tracks the progress and next steps for fixing and improving the CI pipeline for the LLuMinary project. It serves as a guide for agents working on this project to ensure continuity across sessions.

## Identified Issues

The following issues have been identified in the codebase that need to be addressed to make the CI pipeline pass:

### 1. Exception Handling Issues
- ✅ **LLMError and derived classes**: Exception hierarchy needed cleanup and proper type handling
- ✅ **Import statements**: Test files were using old exception names
- ✅ **Error handling patterns**: Handler class had inconsistent error handling

### 2. Type Annotation Issues
- ✅ **Method signatures**: Provider implementations had incompatible signatures with base classes
- ✅ **Optional types**: Many parameters were missing proper Optional annotations
- ✅ **Return types**: Some methods have incorrect return type annotations
- ✅ **Collection types**: Collection[Collection[str]] type handling issues

### 3. Code Style Issues
- ✅ **Line length**: Some lines exceeded the 88 character limit
- ✅ **Trailing whitespace**: Fixed trailing whitespace issues
- ⚠️ **Unused imports**: Multiple files have unused imports
- ⚠️ **Formatting issues**: Some files need black formatting

### 4. Image Processing Issues
- ✅ **PIL imports**: Added proper PIL imports with Resampling for LANCZOS
- ✅ **Image type handling**: Fixed type annotations for PIL.Image
- ⚠️ **Image processing functions**: Some image-related functions still have type issues

### 5. Provider-Specific Implementation Issues
- ✅ **Bedrock provider**: Fixed AWS service client types and image handling
- ⚠️ **Anthropic provider**: Has stream handling and message creation type issues
- ⚠️ **Cohere provider**: Has missing attribute and response handling issues

## Next Steps

### High Priority Tasks

1. **Fix Remaining Test Files**:
   - ⚠️ Several test files still have implementation issues beyond import paths that need to be fixed
   - ⚠️ Fix test files that are still failing when running the full test suite

### Medium Priority Tasks

1. **Address Remaining Image Processing Issues**:
   - ⚠️ Fix image-related functions with proper type annotations
   - ⚠️ Ensure consistent image handling across providers

2. **Code Style and Quality Improvements**:
   - ⚠️ Run black on remaining source files with formatting issues
   - ⚠️ Remove unused imports with isort
   - ⚠️ Fix line length issues in comments and docstrings

3. **Documentation Updates**:
   - ⚠️ Update docstrings to match updated implementations
   - ⚠️ Ensure all parameters are properly documented with types

### Low Priority Tasks

1. **Optimization and Refactoring**:
   - ⚠️ Look for performance improvements in image processing
   - ⚠️ Reduce code duplication across provider implementations
   - ⚠️ Consider unifying common provider functionality

## Implementation Strategy

For best results, implement fixes in this order:
1. Fix remaining test files that are still failing
2. Address code style issues with black and isort
3. Fix remaining image processing issues
4. Update documentation and docstrings

This strategy minimizes conflicts and ensures each component works properly before moving to the next.

- Type annotation issues in provider_template.py have been fixed
- The provider_template.py file now passes mypy and black checks
- The Bedrock provider has been fixed and now passes mypy checks
- Fixed import paths in all test files from 'src.lluminary' to 'lluminary'
- Fixed LLMValidationError class to accept provider parameter like other exception classes
- Fixed test_handler.py file to pass all tests (15/15)
- Created a script (fix_imports.py) to automatically update import paths
- Still need to fix remaining test files that are failing when running the full test suite

## Conclusion

By systematically addressing the issues outlined in this document, we will improve the code quality and ensure the CI pipeline passes successfully. Please record your progress and any new findings to maintain continuity across sessions.
