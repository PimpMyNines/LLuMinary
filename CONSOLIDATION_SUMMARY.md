# Project Consolidation Summary

## Overview
The project was originally developed with two parallel package structures:
- `src/llmhandler/` - Original package name
- `src/lluminary/` - New package name

This caused inconsistency issues in imports, testing, and configuration. The consolidation effort fixed these issues by standardizing on `lluminary` as the package name.

## Changes Made

### 1. Version Update
- Updated version number to `1.0.0` (from 0.0.1/0.1.0)
- Ensured email domain is consistently set to `@pimpmynines.com`

### 2. Package Structure
- Removed the duplicate `src/llmhandler/` directory and its egg-info
- Kept only the `src/lluminary/` package structure

### 3. Import Fixes
- Fixed 334 import statements across 116 files
- Replaced `from src.lluminary` with `from lluminary` imports
- Replaced `import src.lluminary` with `import lluminary` imports

### 4. Path Manipulation Cleanup
- Removed sys.path modifications from 7 test files
- Eliminated unnecessary path manipulation code

### 5. Configuration Updates
- Updated mypy.ini configuration to use `src.lluminary` paths
- Added comprehensive ignore patterns for third-party libraries

### 6. API Consistency
- Fixed handler class naming inconsistency:
  - Updated `LLuMinary` to `LLMHandler` in handler.py
  - Added alias in `__init__.py` for backwards compatibility: `LLMHandler as LLuMinary`
- Added `set_provider_config` and `get_provider_config` functions to models/__init__.py

## Verification Steps

1. **Version Check**
   - Verified new version with `python -c "from lluminary import __version__; print(__version__)"`
   - Successfully returns `1.0.0`

2. **Basic Import Testing**
   - Confirmed package can be imported correctly
   - Verified key components are accessible

3. **Type Checking**
   - Fixed mypy configuration
   - Basic files pass mypy checks

## Remaining Issues

Some tests are still failing, which is expected as they likely need additional fixes beyond the scope of this consolidation:

1. Test failures need addressing
2. Some type checking issues in handler.py need fixing:
   - Incompatible argument types
   - Potential None handling issues with * operator

## Next Steps

1. Fix remaining type issues in src/lluminary/handler.py
2. Update failing tests to align with the consolidated API
3. Run comprehensive test suite to ensure full functionality
4. Update any remaining documentation to reflect the new package name
