# Project History

## Origins
LLuMinary began as an enhancement of the original "llm-handler" project created by Chase Brown (@chaseabrown). The original project provided a unified interface for working with multiple LLM providers.

## Evolution
In early 2024, with Chase's collaboration, the project was significantly enhanced with:
- Modern Python packaging practices
- Expanded provider support
- Improved error handling
- Enhanced documentation
- Comprehensive testing
- Additional features like reranking and enhanced embeddings support

## Current Development
The project is now maintained by PimpMyNines with Chase Brown as a key contributor and technical advisor. The goal is to continue building on Chase's original vision while expanding the library's capabilities and maintaining high code quality standards.
