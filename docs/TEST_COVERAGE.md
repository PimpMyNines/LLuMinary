## Test Implementation Guides

### Provider Test Template

When implementing provider tests, follow this structure:

```python
def test_provider_basic_generation():
    """Test basic text generation with the provider."""
    # Arrange - Setup the provider with mock responses

    # Act - Call the generate method

    # Assert - Verify correct response and token counting

def test_provider_streaming():
    """Test streaming generation with the provider."""
    # Test implementation

def test_provider_embeddings():
    """Test embedding generation with the provider."""
    # Test implementation

def test_provider_reranking():
    """Test document reranking with the provider."""
    # Test implementation

def test_provider_error_handling():
    """Test error handling for various API failures."""
    # Test implementation
```

### Mock Framework

Use the shared mock framework defined in the AGENT_NOTES.md file:

```python
class MockLLM:
    """Base mock LLM implementation for testing."""

    SUPPORTED_MODELS = ["mock-model"]
    THINKING_MODELS = ["mock-model"]
    EMBEDDING_MODELS = ["mock-model"]
    RERANKING_MODELS = []

    CONTEXT_WINDOW = {
        "mock-model": 4096
    }

    COST_PER_MODEL = {
        "mock-model": {
            "read_token": 0.001,
            "write_token": 0.002,
            "image_cost": 0.01
        }
    }

    def __init__(self, model_name="mock-model", **kwargs):
        self.model_name = model_name
        self.config = kwargs

    # Additional mock methods...
```

### Classification Test Approach

For classification tests, use this approach:

```python
def test_classify_from_config():
    """Test classification from config object."""
    # Setup mock classifier and config
    config = ClassificationConfig(...)

    # Setup mock LLM with predefined response
    llm = MockLLM()

    # Call classify method
    categories, usage = llm.classify(config=config, messages=[...])

    # Verify correct categories and usage calculation
    assert categories == [...]
    assert usage["total_tokens"] == ...
    assert usage["total_cost"] == ...
```
