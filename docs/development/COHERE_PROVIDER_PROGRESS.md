6. [Related Documentation](#related-documentation)

## Current Status

- **Completion Status**: 75-80% Complete
- **Number of Tests**: 34 tests passing, 3 skipped
- **Coverage Impact**: Improved from 0% to approximately 75-80%
- **Last Updated**: March 7, 2025

## Testing Implementation

We have implemented comprehensive unit tests for the Cohere provider, covering all major functionality:

1. **Initialization and Configuration Tests**: Complete
2. **Authentication Tests**: Complete (AWS method skipped when not available)
3. **Message Formatting Tests**: Complete
4. **Text Generation Tests**: Complete
5. **Feature Support Detection Tests**: Complete
6. **Image Processing Tests**: Complete
7. **Embeddings Tests**: Complete
8. **Reranking Tests**: Complete
9. **Classification Tests**: Complete
10. **Integration Tests**: Skipped for automated testing (require real API access)

## Key Achievements

1. Improved test coverage from 0% to approximately 75-80%
2. Implemented robust error handling tests
3. Created comprehensive tests for all major functionality
4. Used thorough mocking to test without real API access
5. Created a summary document with testing approach and results

## Next Steps

1. **Stream Generation Testing**: Implement tests for streaming functionality
2. **Advanced Function Calling**: Add more tests for complex tool usage
3. **Integration Testing**: Consider adding integration tests that can be run with real API keys (but skipped in automated testing)

## Remaining Work for Provider Testing

Based on the priorities in AGENT_NOTES.md, the next providers to focus on are:

1. **Google Provider** (14% → target 75%+)
2. **Bedrock Provider** (15% → target 75%+)
3. **Provider Template** (0% → target 75%+)

The approach used for the Cohere provider testing can be applied to these providers as well, focusing on:

1. Initialization and configuration tests
2. Message formatting tests
3. Generation method tests with mocked responses
4. Token counting and cost calculation
5. Error handling and edge cases
6. Provider-specific functionality tests
