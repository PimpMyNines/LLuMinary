# Integration Testing Progress Report

## Current Status (March 7, 2025)
- **Completion Status**: 100% Complete
- **Number of Tests**: 54 integration tests implemented
- **Coverage Impact**: Overall coverage increased from 38% to 65%
- **Last Updated**: March 7, 2025

## Test Suite Overview
We have successfully implemented a comprehensive integration test suite covering all major functionality across providers:

1. **Basic Generation Tests**: System prompts, token limits, cross-provider generation
2. **Advanced Features Tests**: Response processing, retries, function calling, thinking budget
3. **Extended Feature Tests**: JSON mode, long context, tool use, parallel processing
4. **Classification Tests**: Single/multi-category classification, examples
5. **Embeddings Tests**: Single/batch embeddings, similarity calculation
6. **Reranking Tests**: Document reranking across providers
7. **Streaming Tests**: Provider-specific and cross-provider streaming
8. **Cost Tracking Tests**: Tracking costs across different operations
9. **CLI Integration Tests**: Tests for classification CLI commands
10. **Tool Registry Tests**: Tool registration, validation and function calling
11. **Cross-Provider Tests**: Consistent behavior verification
12. **Image Generation Tests**: Basic image generation capabilities

## Key Achievements
- Added robust error handling with graceful skipping when credentials are unavailable
- Implemented cross-provider tests that compare results
- Created comprehensive documentation with test markers
- Enhanced test framework for maintainability

## Next Steps
As integration testing is now complete, our focus should shift to:

1. **Provider Implementation Testing** (Highest Priority)
   - Focus on providers with lowest coverage:
     - Cohere Provider (0%)
     - Provider Template (0%)
     - Google Provider (14%)
     - Bedrock Provider (15%)

2. **Remaining CLI Tests**
   - Current CLI coverage: 30%
   - Need tests for non-classification CLI components

3. **CI/CD Integration**
   - Set up automated testing pipeline
   - Configure test reporting

4. **Type Checking**
   - Add mypy for static type verification
   - Fix type issues in existing code

## Implementation Approach for Provider Testing
For the next phase of testing (provider implementation), we recommend:

1. **Start with Basic Tests**:
   - Initialization and configuration
   - Authentication handling
   - Message formatting

2. **Add Core Functionality Tests**:
   - Generation with different parameters
   - Token counting and cost calculation
   - Error handling

3. **Implement Provider-Specific Tests**:
   - Model-specific features
   - Special formatting requirements
   - Rate limiting handling

This approach will help systematically increase coverage for the remaining providers and complete the test suite.
