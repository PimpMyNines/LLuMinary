# Project Consolidation Update

## Completed Tasks

1. **Package Consolidation**
   - Fixed the package structure to standardize on `lluminary` 
   - Removed the duplicate `src/llmhandler` directory
   - Updated all imports across codebase to use `lluminary` package

2. **Version Update**
   - Updated version to `1.0.0`
   - Fixed email domain to consistently use `@pimpmynines.com`

3. **Configuration Updates**
   - Updated `mypy.ini` to check the correct package paths
   - Added proper import ignores for third-party packages

4. **Core Type Fixes**
   - Fixed implicit Optional parameter issues in multiple files
   - Resolved LLuMinaryError reference to use LLMError
   - Added proper generate method in LLM base class

## Known Remaining Issues

1. **Type Safety**
   - Some type errors remain in `base.py` file
   - Some mypy errors in specialized provider implementations

2. **Test Failures**
   - Most tests are failing but basic tests work
   - Need to systematically update more tests

3. **Documentation**
   - Documentation may still reference `llmhandler` in some places

## Next Steps

1. Complete remaining type fixes in provider implementations
2. Fix test failures systematically
3. Update documentation to ensure consistency

The project is in a much better state but will require additional work to fully resolve all issues.
